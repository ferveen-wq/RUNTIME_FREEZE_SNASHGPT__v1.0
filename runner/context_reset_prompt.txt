  - Service acronyms/names like: PPF, XPEL, VLT
  - Numeric years and numbers like: 2025, 10:00, 7:00
- Example (Arabic line is allowed to be Arabic words, but must keep tokens):
  - "PPF" must appear as "PPF" (not "بي بي إف")
  - "BMW X5" must appear as "BMW X5" (not "بي إم دبليو")

  Arabic first
  English translation below
  No emojis

TOKEN ECHO RULE (HARD):
- If the user's message contains these exact tokens: "BMW" or "X5" or "PPF"

  - Service tokens (e.g., "PPF", "XPEL")
  - Years and numerics (e.g., "2025", "10:00", "7:00")
