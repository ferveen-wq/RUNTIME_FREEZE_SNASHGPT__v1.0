# PHASE 7 — SUMMARY Q&A (DISCUSSION CONSOLIDATION)
# FORMAT: INTERNAL | DISCUSSION | NOT FINAL CONTENT

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION A — YOUR QUESTIONS, CONCERNS & REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

| Q | YOUR QUESTION / CONCERN | AGREED ANSWER |
|---|-------------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Is Phase 7 only education or also sales support? | Phase 7 is education-only, but it INDIRECTLY supports sales by removing fear, confusion, and hesitation. |
| 2 | Can Phase 7 pre-empt objections, silence, negotiation? | Yes. Phase 7 pre-empts by educating BEFORE objections surface, not by arguing after. |
| 3 | Can brand credibility be emphasized (regional reality)? | Yes, but as VERIFICATION & LEGITIMACY education, not brand promotion or superiority. |
| 4 | How do we handle fake “UK/US” re-marketed brands? | By educating customers how to VERIFY real brands (presence, history, footprint), not by attacking others. |
| 5 | Can price comparison pressure be addressed here? | Yes, through education on value, risk transfer, ownership cost — NOT pricing or offers. |
| 6 | Can we include combo logic or add-ons like interior ceramic? | Only as EDUCATION (why complementary layers exist), never as bundles or offers. |
| 7 | Can we educate on pre-cut vs manual, thickness myths? | Yes. These are key education topics, placed under comparison & confusion resolution. |
| 8 | Can we reassure customers it’s okay to wait or not buy now? | Yes. Phase 7 includes ethical stop points and decision patience education. |
| 9 | Can we use real-world analogies (tyres, Toyota, airlines)? | Yes, as neutral decision-framing analogies, not selling pressure. |
|10 | Can assistants paste examples manually if customer hesitates? | Yes. Assistants may pull ONE example from Phase 7 after permission, without unlocking phrase library. |
|11 | Will locked Human Phrase Library still work with this? | Yes. Phrase library opens the door; Phase 7 supplies the depth. |
|12 | Can Google reviews / testimonials be hinted indirectly? | Yes, by educating customers HOW to evaluate reviews, not by pointing to our profiles. |
|13 | Will uploading wrong or scattered files cause loss? | No. All valuable content is extracted, tagged, and parked safely. |
|14 | Is now the right time to capture months of scattered work? | Yes. Phase 7 is the correct “knowledge vault” stage. |

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION B — IDEAS & STRUCTURE I PROPOSED
--------------------------------------------------------------------

| Q | IDEA / STRUCTURE PROPOSED | AGREED OUTCOME |
|---|---------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Phase 7 as a REFERENCE layer, not execution | Agreed. Phase 7 is never executed directly. |
| 2 | Split Phase 7 into 5 strict sections | Agreed (Education, Comparison, Maintenance, Credibility, Objection/Silence). |
| 3 | Section 1 = Core Education only | Agreed. No brands, no comparisons, no pricing here. |
| 4 | Use education to remove fear instead of persuasion | Agreed. Education first, selling never. |
| 5 | Brand as reassurance anchor, not negotiation handler | Agreed with regional tightening (verification focus). |
| 6 | Decision-framing concepts (risk, regret, patience) | Agreed. Captured for Phase 7 sections. |
| 7 | Real-world analogies bank | Agreed. Stored in Phase 7 backlog, not phrases. |
| 8 | Assistants can reinforce with examples | Agreed, under strict rules (one example, permission-based). |
| 9 | Strict sourcing before writing | Agreed and followed (batches, extraction, freeze). |
|10 | No drift: extract → map → freeze → write | Agreed and enforced. |
