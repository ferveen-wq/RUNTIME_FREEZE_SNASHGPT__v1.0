# PHASE 4 — SIGNAL → INTENT MAPPING TABLE (v1.1)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PURPOSE
Phase 4 exists to reinforce confidence AFTER pricing, without sounding defensive
or changing commercial terms. It reassures, clarifies lightly, and opens Phase 5
via permission-based progression.

HARD RULES
- Phase 4 runs ONLY after Phase 3B pricing exposure
- Phase 4 must NOT:
  • change price
  • negotiate
  • stack reassurances
  • ask more than ONE question
- Exactly ONE dominant signal is selected per turn
- Output structure is always:
  C) Baseline Reassurance (1 sentence)
  D) Optional Micro-Education (0–1 sentence)
  E) Permission-Based Question (1 question only)

SIGNAL SELECTION RULE
If multiple signals are detected, choose the highest-risk signal only.
Priority order (highest → lowest):
1) PRICE_PRESSURE
2) BRAND_FIXATION / COMPARISON
3) USAGE_PATTERN (highway / city / harsh use)
4) WARRANTY_SENSITIVITY
5) DECISION_HESITATION / SILENCE_RISK

SIGNAL → INTENT → PHASE 4 RESPONSE MAP
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SIGNAL: PRICE_PRESSURE = HIGH
INTENT:
Customer is unsure whether the price difference is justified.

C) BASELINE REASSURANCE
"That’s why two prices can look far apart even when the coverage sounds similar."

D) MICRO-EDUCATION (optional)
"The difference usually shows over time in film stability, clarity, and durability."

E) PERMISSION QUESTION
"If you want, I can explain where that difference comes from, or share a short install
video on a similar car so you can see it clearly."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SIGNAL: BRAND_FIXATION or BRAND_COMPARISON
INTENT:
Customer is anchoring decision on brand reputation or name.

C) BASELINE REASSURANCE
"Brands mainly differ in long-term clarity, self-healing consistency, and how they age."

D) MICRO-EDUCATION (optional)
"Most films look similar at first — performance shows after months of use."

E) PERMISSION QUESTION
"If you want, I can walk you through the differences, or share a quick install video
on a similar car."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SIGNAL: USAGE_PATTERN = HIGHWAY / HARSH USE
INTENT:
Customer cares about real-world durability.

C) BASELINE REASSURANCE
"On highway-driven cars, the difference usually shows in stone impact resistance
and heat stability."

D) MICRO-EDUCATION (optional)
"This is where film thickness and adhesive quality matter most."

E) PERMISSION QUESTION
"If you want, I can explain how that affects long-term protection, or show you
a short install video on a similar X5."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SIGNAL: WARRANTY_SENSITIVITY
INTENT:
Customer is using warranty as a safety proxy.

C) BASELINE REASSURANCE
"Warranty is there as assurance — performance is what you feel day to day."

D) MICRO-EDUCATION (optional)
"Installation quality plays a big role in how well warranties actually hold up."

E) PERMISSION QUESTION
"If you want, I can explain how warranties work in real use, or share a quick
install example."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SIGNAL: DECISION_HESITATION / SILENCE_RISK
INTENT:
Customer is unsure how to proceed or is slowing down.

C) BASELINE REASSURANCE
"Totally fine — this is the stage where most people just want clarity."

D) MICRO-EDUCATION (optional)
"Seeing the process often makes the decision easier."

E) PERMISSION QUESTION
"If you want, I can walk you through how we prep and install the car, or share
a short install video so you can see it first."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GOVERNANCE
- Phase 4 must always feel calm, optional, and customer-led
