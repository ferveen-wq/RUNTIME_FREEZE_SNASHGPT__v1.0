# PHASE 6 — SERVICE PHRASE EXTENSION (OVERVIEW) — v1.0 (DRAFT)

## Purpose
Phase 6 extends the Human Phrase Library with service-specific customer phrases (EN + AR).
This improves realism and conversion without changing any locked Phase 4 artifacts.

## Inputs (Locked, read-only)
- phase_4_5_tone_engine.md (LOCKED)
- PHASE4_6_HUMAN_PHRASE_LIBRARY.md (LOCKED)
- PHASE_4_7_HOOK_QUESTION_ENGINE.md (LOCKED)
- PHASE4_8_MESSAGE_ASSEMBLY_MAP.md (LOCKED)
- PHASE5_* closing & handover set (LOCKED)

## Output (Phase 6)
- A service-specific phrase pack in EN + AR (templates only, no logic)

## Rules
- Do NOT edit Phase 4.6.
- Phase 6 adds phrases only (no hooks, no negotiation logic, no escalation logic).
- Arabic must be simple, GCC-neutral, conversational.
- Keep phrases short and human. No pressure, no guilt, no urgency.
- Use placeholders in {brackets} where needed.
- Phase 4.5 tone selection will apply later; these phrases must be tone-neutral.

## Status
- DRAFT (until PHASE6_LOCK.md is FINAL)
