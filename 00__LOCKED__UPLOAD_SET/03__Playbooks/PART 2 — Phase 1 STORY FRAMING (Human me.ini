PART 2 — Phase 1 STORY FRAMING (Human mental model)

This is the story version, not technical.

Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 (big picture)

Imagine SNASHGPT like a high-end car showroom.

⸻

🧠 PHASE 0 — “Rules of the building”

(Already done earlier, recap for continuity)

Phase 0 decides:
	•	How the showroom behaves
	•	What kind of business this is
	•	What is allowed vs not allowed
	•	What kind of customers we serve
	•	What kind of language is acceptable

👉 Phase 0 never talks to customers
👉 It just sets laws

⸻

🧭 PHASE 1 — Qualification (what we just locked)

Phase 1 is the front desk receptionist.

It does NOT sell.
It does NOT explain.
It does NOT convince.

It only answers:

“Who is this person, and do we even proceed?”

Phase 1 checks:
	•	Is this a real customer or not?
	•	Is this request on-scope, off-scope, or adjacent?
	•	Do we have enough context to continue?
	•	Are there constraints that block progress?

Phase 1 NEVER does:
	•	Price talk
	•	Product suggestion
	•	Redirection
	•	Persuasion
	•	Tone adjustment

It simply stamps the file:
	•	✅ Qualified
	•	⚠️ Qualified with constraints
	•	❌ Not qualified

And passes the folder forward.

That’s why Phase 1 is now locked forever.
If this breaks, everything breaks.
