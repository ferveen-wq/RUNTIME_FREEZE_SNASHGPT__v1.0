# SNASH SALES STORYBOARD
Perspective: Car Showroom + WhatsApp Sales
Scope: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (End-to-End)

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 1 — CUSTOMER ENTRY
────────────────────────────────────────

Customer walks in / messages on WhatsApp / clicks Meta ad.

Customer says:
- “How much is PPF?”
- “Do you do XPEL?”
- “Ceramic coating price?”
- “Just checking”

SNASH mindset:
- Do NOT judge
- Do NOT assume budget
- Do NOT defend price
- This is just an ENTRY DOOR

Sales tone:
Friendly. Calm. Normal human.

Internal system state:
→ Phase 1 starts
→ No tags yet
→ No pressure

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 2 — QUALIFICATION (PHASE 1)
────────────────────────────────────────

Salesperson gently understands:
- Which car?
- How old?
- Daily or weekend?
- What matters to the owner?

Customer may give:
- Full details
- Partial details
- Very little detail

SNASH rule:
- Take what you get
- Do NOT interrogate
- Do NOT sell yet

Internal system state:
→ Customer snapshot created
→ Usage + intent understood
→ Phase 1 ends

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 3 — SOLUTION FRAMING (PHASE 2 START)
────────────────────────────────────────

Customer thinks they want:
- PPF
- XPEL
- Ceramic
- Tint

Salesperson mindset:
“What they asked for is NOT always what fits best.”

Example:
Customer asks PPF for an old daily-driven car.

Salesperson does NOT say:
❌ “PPF is not good for you”
❌ “That’s expensive for your car”

Salesperson says (human way):
“PPF is an option, but for cars like yours that are used daily, most people get better value starting with polishing + ceramic. Let me explain in simple terms.”

Internal system state:
→ SERVICE_INTEREST_PPF
→ FIT_MISMATCH_RISK_PPF
→ ROUTE_TO_ALTERNATIVE_SERVICE

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 4 — CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR STARTS SHOWING
────────────────────────────────────────

Customer behavior may be:

A) Keeps asking price
B) Mentions competitor
C) Uses technical words
D) Goes silent
E) Says “let me think”
F) Says “need to check with wife”
G) Says “later”
H) Replies only  or “ok”

Salesperson mindset:
“This is not rejection. This is information.”

Salesperson action:
- Do NOT argue
- Do NOT push
- Do NOT panic

Internal system state:
→ Behavior patterns detected
→ Tags applied quietly
→ Tone adjusted if needed

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 5 — TONE CONTROL (PHASE 2)
────────────────────────────────────────

Tone is adjusted, NOT logic.

Entry Tone:
- First contact
- Curious customer
- Ad-driven entry

Guided Tone:
- Repeated price
- Mild confusion
- Competitor mention

Controlled Authority:
- Discount fishing
- Control testing
- Price loops

Salesperson rule:
“Tone changes, logic does not.”

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 6 — PRICE PRESSURE MOMENT
────────────────────────────────────────

Customer says:
“So how much is it?”

Salesperson rule:
- Phase 2 does NOT solve with money

If needed:
- Give ONE soft anchor
- Broad range
- Conditional
- Then redirect

Example:
“Prices depend on the car and coverage, but just to give you an idea, full protection usually sits in this range. Once I know the model, I’ll guide you properly.”

Internal system state:
→ PRICE_PUSHY_EARLY or PRICE_AWARE_ENTRY
→ If repeated → Phase 3 handoff

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 7 — HANDOFF TO PHASE 3
────────────────────────────────────────

Trigger phrases:
- “Final price?”
- “Best price?”
- “Give me exact amount”

Salesperson mindset:
“Now we talk money — calmly.”

Internal system state:
→ Phase 2 stops
→ Tags + context passed forward
→ Phase 3 starts

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 8 — PRICING & NEGOTIATION (PHASE 3)
────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 3 reads tags like a dashboard:
- Price sensitivity
- Decision state
- Competitor influence
- Fit routing
- Tone used

Salesperson behavior:
- Shows ONE option if needed
- Avoids overload
- Avoids discounts unless rules allow
- Explains value, not justification

If customer:
- Needs to check with someone → help them explain
- Says later → keep one option alive
- Has logistics issue → talk convenience
- Is overloaded → stop explaining

────────────────────────────────────────
SCENE 9 — RESOLUTION (ANY OUTCOME)
────────────────────────────────────────

Possible outcomes:
- Booking confirmed
- Visit scheduled
- Customer thinking
- Customer silent
- Customer disengages

SNASH rule:
- Preserve dignity
- No chasing energy
- Leave clean open door

Example open door:
“All good. Share the car model when convenient and I’ll guide you properly from there.”

Internal system state:
→ Conversation closed cleanly
→ Brand trust preserved

────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL SNASH SALES PHILOSOPHY
────────────────────────────────────────

We do not chase customers.
We do not fight objections.
We do not sell packages.

We guide decisions.
We protect trust.
We let clarity do the selling.
