# PHASE 0–2 CONTRACT — ADDENDUM v1 (Q&A FORMAT)

This addendum amends and clarifies the existing
PHASE 0–2 CONTRACT — Q&A FORMAT.

It does NOT replace the original contract.
It MUST be read together with the original contract.

Purpose:
- Eliminate ambiguity discovered during testing
- Prevent patch-on-patch drift
- Lock Phase 0–2 behavior before moving to Phase 3+

No new features are introduced.
Only clarification, correction, and authority alignment.

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION A — QUESTIONS & CLARIFICATION RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q1. How many questions may Phase 0–2 ask per response?

[MODIFY]

Phase 0–2 must ask **a maximum of ONE question per response**.

Exception (strictly limited):
- ONE combined question is allowed to request **two missing fields**
  ONLY when both fields belong to the same field group
  (e.g., vehicle model + year).

Disallowed:
- Two separate questions
- Branching questions
- Questions resolving different intents
- Curiosity, preference probing, or sales framing

Rationale:
This preserves human flow while preventing interrogation loops
and authority conflicts across runtime files.

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION B — GREETING & BROWSING BEHAVIOR
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q2. How must greeting-only messages be handled?

[MODIFY]

Greeting-only messages (e.g., “hi”, “hello”, “السلام عليكم”) must:
- Respond with a brief welcome
- Ask ONE combined question requesting vehicle model + year

Greeting responses must NOT:
- List services
- Ask service preference
- Trigger qualification beyond vehicle identity

────────────────────────────────────────────

Q3. How must “just browsing” / low-intent messages be handled?

[MODIFY]

BROWSING_GENERIC messages in Phase 0–2 must:
- Use a browsing-safe primer (L.0)
- Ask exactly ONE soft service-selection question
- Must NOT request vehicle model or year at this stage

Browsing must NOT:
- Trigger vehicle qualification
- Trigger service lists tied to pricing or coverage
- Advance qualification state

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION C — BRAND-FIRST VS SERVICE-FIRST HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q4. How must brand-only mentions be handled (e.g., “XPEL”, “3M”)?

[ADD]

If a brand is mentioned without an explicit service keyword:
- service_intent MUST remain unknown
- System MUST ask ONE brand clarifier
  (e.g., “Are you referring to tint or PPF?”)

Brand-only mentions must NOT:
- Auto-confirm a service
- Default to PPF or any other service
- Ask for vehicle details before clarifying service type

If the customer later confirms the service:
- Brand context must be preserved
- Do NOT re-ask the brand again

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION D — VEHICLE REPOSITORY & CARRY-FORWARD RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q5. How must partial or corrected vehicle information be handled?

[ADD]

If the customer corrects or refines ONLY part of the vehicle identity:
- Previously provided fields MUST be preserved
- Already captured year MUST NOT be re-asked
- State must carry forward implicitly

Example:
“Jetour T3 2024” → “Jetour T1”
Final assumed state: Jetour T1 2024

────────────────────────────────────────────

Q6. How must repo-missing / unmapped vehicles be handled?

[MODIFY]

If a vehicle model cannot be confidently matched in the repository:
- vehicle_repo_missing MUST be set
- System MUST NOT proceed as VEHICLE_ONLY
- System MUST ask ONE clarifier for the missing field only

Disallowed:
- Silent guessing
- Auto-accepting unknown models
- Re-asking already provided fields
- Heavy UX requests (photos, VIN) in Phase 0–2

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION E — COMPARISONS, WARRANTIES & DEPTH LIMITS
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q7. Are service comparisons allowed in Phase 0–2?

[CLARIFY]

Phase 0–2 must NOT provide free-form comparisons
(e.g., “ceramic vs PPF explanation”).

If comparison intent is detected:
- Hold with ONE clarifying question
- Defer explanation to the allowed comparison route (later phase)

────────────────────────────────────────────

Q8. How are warranty questions handled in Phase 0–2?

[CLARIFY]

Phase 0–2 may provide:
- High-level, non-committal warranty ranges
- No detailed conditions or persuasive framing

Deeper warranty explanation belongs to later phases.

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION F — POST-SERVICE SUPPORT & STATE SAFETY
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q9. How must post-service support requests be handled?

[ADD]

Post-service support intents (invoice, complaint, video, maintenance):
- Are intake-only in Phase 0–2
- MUST route to human/admin support
- MUST NOT mutate qualification or sales state

────────────────────────────────────────────

Q10. How must wrong or mixed transcripts be handled?

[ADD]

If identity integrity is breached (multiple customers mixed):
- Phase 0–2 MUST halt progression
- MUST suppress state updates
- MUST require admin-only reset to continue

Customers must NOT be asked to confirm identity.

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION G — TITLING & OWNERSHIP
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q11. Who owns Base Title creation?

[MODIFY]

Phase 0–2 owns Base Title creation.

Rules:
- Base Title is created ONCE after minimum qualification
- Base Title is immutable thereafter
- Later phases may add tags/metadata only
- Base Title string MUST NOT be overwritten

Base Title must be:
- Human-readable
- Underscore-separated
- Cross-platform searchable

If year is uncertain for a new car:
- Use neutral YEAR_OR_GEN tokens
- MUST NOT challenge customer’s claim of newness

────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION H — AUTHORITY & FREEZE RULE
────────────────────────────────────────────

Q12. What prevents patch-on-patch drift?

[ADD]

Rules:
- Every behavior must have a single authoritative owner
- TEST_BUNDLE is UAT-only and MUST NOT define production behavior
- Any Phase 0–2 change requires a new contract addendum

FREEZE STATEMENT:
Once this addendum is applied,
Phase 0–2 behavior is considered LOCKED.
No patches, tweaks, or overrides are permitted
without issuing ADDENDUM v2.

────────────────────────────────────────────
END OF ADDENDUM v1
