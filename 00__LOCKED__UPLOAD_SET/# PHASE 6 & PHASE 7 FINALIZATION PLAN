## PHASE OWNERSHIP CLARITY (FROZEN)

### Phase 6 — SERVICE PHRASE EXTENSION
**Role:** Signal, frame, anchor trust  
**Nature:** Always-on, short, non-reactive

Phase 6 ALLOWED content:
1. Brand philosophy & ethics
2. Company credibility (Snash signals)
   - multi-branch presence
   - training standards
   - internal quality culture
3. Product / manufacturer naming (signal-level only)
   - e.g. Envoz, 3M, XPEL (no comparisons)
4. Service definition (what it is)
5. Service scope boundaries (what it is not)
6. High-level inclusions / exclusions
7. Process philosophy (WHY, not HOW)
8. Quality & safety reassurance (generic)
9. Differentiation signals (tiers exist, no details)
10. Expectation tone-setting (light, non-defensive)

Phase 6 EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES:
- objections
- competitor offers
- pricing logic
- maintenance schedules
- product tier breakdowns
- education
- negotiation
- visuals

Phase 6 = **Front Door Trust Layer**

---

### Phase 7 — EDUCATION & EXPLANATION BLOCKS
**Role:** Explain friction, correct misunderstanding, restore momentum  
**Nature:** Conditional, deeper, triggered by hooks

Phase 7 CONTAINS:
A. Product tier education (5y / 8y / 10y, Ceramic 1y / 3y / 5y)
B. Specification & marketing myth education (thickness, warranty myths)
C. Competitor offer forecasting (free wash, EMI, lifetime claims)
D. Price & value explanation (non-closing)
E. Service-specific maintenance education
F. Environment & usage education (heat, parking, washing)
G. Color, finish & visual outcome education
H. Process, risk & correction handling
I. Comparison & decision support (PPF vs Ceramic vs Wrap)
J. Visual interpretation guidance
K. Post-education steering bridges

Phase 7 EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES:
- hooks/questions
- urgency
- closing language
- discounts
- emotional pressure

Phase 7 = **Guided Depth Layer**

## BUILD SEQUENCE (RECOMMENDED)

### STEP 1 — PHASE 6 GOVERNANCE FREEZE
- Update Phase 6 header with confirmed scope
- Explicitly state:
  “All depth, differentiation, and education live in Phase 7”
- No service content written yet

⏱ Time: 0.5 day

---

### STEP 2 — PHASE 6 CONTENT BUILD
- Build service modules one by one
- Focus on:
  - credibility signals
  - scope clarity
  - differentiation signals (no details)
- Keep each service concise

⏱ Time: 1–2 days (depending on number of services)

FREEZE Phase 6 after review.

---

### STEP 3 — PHASE 7 GOVERNANCE DEFINITION
- Define:
  - what an education block is
  - length limits
  - tone constraints
  - how control returns to sales
- Create block naming & indexing rules

⏱ Time: 0.5–1 day

---

### STEP 4 — PHASE 7 PILOT BLOCKS
Start with HIGH-IMPACT blocks:
1. Thickness & specification myth education
2. Product tier differentiation (PPF + Ceramic)
3. Competitor offer forecasting

Reuse existing material where possible.

⏱ Time: 1–2 days

---

### STEP 5 — PHASE 7 EXPANSION (ITERATIVE)
Add blocks gradually based on:
- real conversations
- objection frequency
- sales feedback

No freeze required initially — Phase 7 is expandable.

⏱ Ongoing (parallel to usage)

---

## FINAL ARCHITECTURE SNAPSHOT (LOCKED)

Phase 6 → Signal & Frame  
Phase 7 → Explain & Educate  
Phase 4.7 → Detect & Steer  
Phase 4.6 → Human Language  
Phase 5 → Ethical Close  

No overlaps. No conflicts.

---

## KEY PRINCIPLE (TO AVOID FUTURE CONFUSION)
If content is:
- proactive → Phase 6
- reactive → Phase 7
- behavioral → Runtime
- persuasive close → Phase 5
