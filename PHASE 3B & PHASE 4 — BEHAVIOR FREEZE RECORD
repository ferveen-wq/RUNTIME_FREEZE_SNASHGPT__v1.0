# PHASE 3B & PHASE 4 — BEHAVIOR FREEZE RECORD
Version: v1.0
Status: LOCKED (Behavior)
Date: 2026-02-09

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3B — PRICING BEHAVIOR (LOCKED)
────────────────────────────────────────

Purpose:
- Phase 3B exists to present price logically, not to persuade emotionally.

Allowed:
- Present price ranges and options
- Explain price differences factually (coverage, brand, durability)
- Respond to price pressure with laddering (down or up)
- Ask ONE clarification question if required by the price ladder

Explicitly NOT allowed:
- Emotional persuasion
- Reassurance language
- Warranty defense
- Brand advocacy beyond factual comparison
- Education deep-dives (installation, prep, materials)

Signals handled:
- PRICE_PRESSURE
- COMPETITOR_MENTION
- COVERAGE_SCOPE

Outputs:
- Neutral price presentation
- Clear option framing
- Decision-enabling question (one max)

Note:
Copy is baseline by design. Optimization is deferred.

────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4 — CONFIDENCE & REASSURANCE LAYER (LOCKED)
────────────────────────────────────────

Purpose:
- Phase 4 exists to stabilize confidence AFTER pricing.
- It does NOT sell, discount, or renegotiate.

Core behavior:
- Reassurance based on the single dominant customer signal
- Permission-based education or visual proof
- Calm normalization of concerns

Allowed:
- One reassurance statement
- One permission-based offer (explain OR show)
- Conditional insert based on dominant signal only

Explicitly NOT allowed:
- Multiple reassurances in one message
- Defensiveness or justification stacking
- Repeating price
- Discounting or re-laddering
- Closing language

Signals eligible (one at a time):
- PRICE_PRESSURE
- COMPARISON_FOCUS
- BRAND_FIXATION
- WARRANTY_SENSITIVITY
- USAGE_PATTERN (e.g., highway)

Example permission phrasing (pattern only):
“If you want, I can explain how we prep and install it, or share a short video on a similar car.”

Note:
Phase 4 copy is baseline and intentionally conservative.

────────────────────────────────────────
PRO OPTIMIZATION STATUS
────────────────────────────────────────

- ChatGPT Pro has NOT been run for Phase 3B or Phase 4.
- No persuasive optimization has been applied.
- This is intentional to prevent premature overfitting.

Future optimization will occur ONLY after:
- Phase 5 education layer is live
- Real customer objections are observed
- Architecture remains unchanged

────────────────────────────────────────
CHANGE POLICY
────────────────────────────────────────

Any change to:
- Phase 3B persuasion level
- Phase 4 reassurance scope
- Signal priority rules

Requires:
- Update to this document
- Explicit approval before runtime patches
